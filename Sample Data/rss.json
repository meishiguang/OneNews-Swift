My partner Herb Peckham and I were free-lance writers brought in to create a manual for Macintosh Basic, which we did. More about that later. I first met Donn when we were both serving on the ANSI Basic Standards committee, whose goal was to set up specifications for a modern version of Basic that would contain loop structures, if-then blocks, and procedure calls, so the notorious GO TO statement could go away. Tom Kurtz, co-inventor of Dartmouth Basic, was also active on the ANSI committee. I\u0026#x27;ve known Tom since 1965, when I was teaching physics at Dartmouth, and I knew Tom was keen on implementing a modern, structured version of Basic, and getting beyond the old (and much-criticized) line-number-dependent language that was becoming ubiquitous on micros, thanks to Bill Gates\u0026#x27;s interpreter (which was mostly correct, except if you wrote FOR I = 1 TO 0, the loop would be executed once:no pre-test). I had added graphics primitives to Dartmouth Basic around 1976 and developed an X-Y pen-plotter to carry out graphics commands mixed in with the text being sent to Teletype terminals. My interest on the ANSI committee was to make sure the new Basic had a standard set of graphics statements. It became clear that Donn also wanted Macintosh Basic to be a modern, structured language that would leave Applesoft Basic as a memory. I pressed for Mac Basic to also include the graphics statements we were standardizing on the committee, and Donn ultimately agreed. That was around 1979. By that time I was at the Lawrence Hall of Science at UC Berkeley heading a program to teach kids about computers, both at LHS and remotely via Teletypes in Bay Area schools. We also had Commodore Pets, and we outfitted a van to take wheeled desks with mounted Apple IIs out to schools. Essentially, we taught programing in Basic on all systems. I left the Hall in 1980 and, with Martha Luehrmann and Herb Peckham, started Computer Literacy Press. Our purpose was to serve the needs of all the new computer users that were suddenly appearing, thanks to micros. Our first book project was \u0026quot;Apple Pascal:A Hands-On Approach.\u0026quot; Apple liked it and included a copy with each Pascal software package it sold. (If anyone is interested, I still have a dozen copies of the book.) That brings us to Macintosh Basic.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EApple invited us to create \u0026quot;Macintosh Basic:A Hands-On Approach\u0026quot; and have it ready in time for shipping with the software, which was six or eight months away. Herb and I took up offices at Apple and met with Donn several times a week to review progress. And what a pleasure it was to work with Donn! He was good at explaining details we had questions about, and he was completely open to ideas we had about the graphics elements. The same was true of Marianne Hsiung. So, as the months went by, it looked like Macintosh Basic would be the user-oriented language for the Mac:and it would be great. Our book was finished and in page proof, ready for the press. BUT . . . Steve Jobs invited me into his office one morning. Our office was a few doors away, and we talked from time to time. Steve seemed uncertain about something. Then he handed me a disk and said, \u0026quot;What do you think about this?\u0026quot; I took it to our Mac, loaded the software, and what I saw was Microsoft\u0026#x27;s version of Basic for the Mac. Against Donn\u0026#x27;s and Marianne\u0026#x27;s creation, it looked antique: no structured programming elements, line numbers essential for GO TOs, primitive graphics commands, limited data types:a throwback, in a word. So, the next day I went back to see Steve. He asked, \u0026quot;What do you think?\u0026quot; I said, \u0026quot;Steve, it\u0026#x27;s a piece of shit.\u0026quot; He didn\u0026#x27;t say anything, but looked grim. A week or so later, we learned that Apple\u0026#x27;s Macintosh Basic project had been canceled. Andy Herzfeld explains the situation accurately. The Apple II was the cash cow at that time, and without Applesoft Basic it would be worthless. Gates played hardball, and Apple caved. And so, sitting on a shelf in our basement are the page proofs of our book, \u0026quot;Macintosh Basic:A Hands-On Approach.\u0026quot; It\u0026#x27;s the best of the 20 or 30 books we\u0026#x27;ve done. But the saddest thing to me is that the Mac shipped with no user-level programming language. It was the beginning of the end of ordinary people writing their own programs. Computer buyers became customers of programs (now renamed \u0026quot;applications\u0026quot;) written by experts, not creators of their own, albeit modest, programs.

They are following the Longevity Dividend [0] approach in essence, which at the high level aims to increase understanding of the intersection of genetics, metabolism, and aging to produce ways to slow aging gently. Ambition here is to aim for an increase of 7 years of life expectancy over the next two decades, a figure given a couple of times by Jay Olshansky. Examples of research include work on sirtuins, that has consumed a billion dollars and produced nothing of use, and other attempts to produce caloric restriction mimetic drugs. The near future in the Longevity Dividend vision is basically more of the same: vastly expensive attempts to alter the operation of metabolism in order to slow down aging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenetics is hot, and it is easy to raise funds for nowadays. See the launch of Venter\u0026#x27;s Human Longevity Inc, for example. But I see this in connection with work on longevity as looking for the keys under the lamp, because that is where the light is, not because it is where you are likely to obtain results. The comparative genetics of human longevity should be irrelevant to work on aging: we all age because of the occurrence of the same forms of cellular and molecular damage. Outside of rare mutations, genetics has nothing to do with that - the same damage happens to everyone. The target should be repair of that damage, not trying to expensively slightly slow the pace at which it arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat the metabolic manipulation approach to treating aging has such popularity despite the lack of results is a mystery. The other way, the repair approach, has the same lack of results - but that is because next to no money is heading in that direction. We have the early demonstration that targeted removal of senescent cells extends life in accelerated aging mice [1], for example, and ample reason to believe it is beneficial for ordinary individuals, but it took philanthropic funding to move that research forward at all. Institutions want to see standard issue drug development and manipulation of metabolism because it is the mainstream of medicine and the expected thing: the round peg for the round hole of regulation. This has nothing at all to do with whether it is the best path forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all further points to the fact that if we want to see meaningful results in longevity science, measured in years of health gained for people who are already old, then we need to produce results that demonstrate the futility of the mainstream path taken by Google, the sirtuin researchers, and Human Longevity Inc, etc, and deonstrate that repair approaches can do far more for far less money. The senescent cell targeting is probably the closest work to that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on what I\u0026#x27;ve seen of Calico to date, I\u0026#x27;m expecting it to be a more publicized version of the Ellison Medical Foundation as an initiative: an extension of work already taking place at the NIA and in companies like Human Longevity Inc, and something that fails to step outside that box. It will produce general benefits in terms of data and knowledge, and absolutely fail to meaningfully extend human life. This will continue until someone changes the approach to this work to focus on repair of the causes of aging [2] rather than metabolic tinkering to slow aging. The latter is a slow road to marginal end results that can do next to nothing to help the people who grew old waiting for them to arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[0]: \u003Ca href=\"https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2013/10/advocating-the-longevity-dividend-view.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.fightaging.org\u0026#x2F;archives\u0026#x2F;2013\u0026#x2F;10\u0026#x2F;advocating-the-l...\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1]: \u003Ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10600\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Ehttp:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;dx.doi.org\u0026#x2F;10.1038\u0026#x2F;nature10600\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[2]: \u003Ca href=\"http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Ehttp:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.sens.org\u0026#x2F;research\u0026#x2F;introduction-to-sens-research\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","points":1,"parent_id":8157921,"story_id":8157921,"children":[{"id":8158063,"created_at":"2014-08-09T21:29:11.000Z","created_at_i":1407619751,"type":"comment","author":"dannyr","text":"\u003Cp\u003EThis comment and some of the others show the ugly side of HN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJudging a company just based on a web site.

I\u0026#x27;ve met people with similar views before, but usually they\u0026#x27;re reluctant to describe them at length.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that traces of people remain after their death -- genetically, in their children, and in the memories of those who knew them. But those traces fade quickly, and for all but the most famous, virtually disappear in a few centuries. And surely you agree that a memory is a poor substitute for a person -- I\u0026#x27;d rather be able to talk to my dad or neighbor than have even the fondest memories of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe both seem to agree that improving the quality of people\u0026#x27;s lives, as well as the quantity, is extremely important. Aging is far from the only problem society faces. Tackling inequality\u0026#x2F;poverty, political dysfunction, war, ignorance, and other problems are also extremely important goals, and I greatly respect people who work on them. I also recognize that curing aging will introduce new societal problems even as it solves others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think where we differ is that I think these other problems can be solved as well, and I believe that curing aging will, on balance help society more than it harms it. Consider how our scientific progress is retarded when our best scientists die or lose their mental acuity later in life. I\u0026#x27;ve already alluded to the fact that people seem to ignore problems ranging from global warming to the national debt because \u0026quot;I\u0026#x27;ll be dead before it becomes a problem.\u0026quot;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have several responses to your concern that if people stop aging, we won\u0026#x27;t have room for future generations. First, it is well known that wealthier people and countries have a lower birth rate, so by solving poverty, the birth rate will decrease. Second, even if people don\u0026#x27;t age, they can still die from accidents or disease. Also, I think eventually humanity will expand to the stars, although we are far from it now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMassive societal change is coming, from many sources, whether or not aging is solved (although I make no claims about when). Technology is going to put many people out of work. AI will eventually be created. Methods will be developed to improve human intelligence, enhancing technological development but increasing wealth inequality. Even if none of these developments occur, there is still an increasing centralization of wealth and power in developed countries. It is hard to know how curing aging would interact with these trends, except to say that I think people would be more circumspect about societal decisions if they knew they would have to bear the long-term consequences. Living longer would also give people more time to get educated, which would help with the electoral ignorance that is at the root of so many problems in the US.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, your proposed principle for determining the \u0026quot;correct\u0026quot; lifespan is not a new one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; When you start to try and reverse or disable aging as opposed to attempting to cure disease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe NIH takes a similar view. The problem is that almost all major diseases (diabetes, heart disease, neurodegenerative disease, to some extent cancer) are all diseases of aging. Young people don\u0026#x27;t (usually) get them. It may well be that to \u0026quot;cure\u0026quot; these diseases, we will have to solve the underlying problem -- that is, aging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, consider that it is just genetic happenstance that our species max lifespan happens to be 120. Why should it not be 15 or 60 or 240?
