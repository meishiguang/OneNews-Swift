This is an advantage.  It is nonsense for a customer to walk openly onto an aircraft carrying a rifle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think \u0026quot;airport security\u0026quot; has much less to do with passenger security than the risks inherent with allowing planes to fly through our skies.  9\u0026#x2F;11 is a clear example that many more people than the \u003Ci\u003Epassengers\u003C/i\u003E of the flight can be affected via air-terrorism.  This is why planes are controlled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0026#x27;m not opposed to that control; I just marvel at how awful a job the U.S. government does at determing the cost\u0026#x2F;convenience\u0026#x2F;effectiveness tradeoffs.  In my experience in the United States, this seems to be a systemic problem with governmentally-administered services that does not seem to exist so much in other governments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere aren\u0026#x27;t many airlines, and I expect the overwhelming majority of consumers would consistently purchase the cheapest option.  If airlines are the agency entrusted with safe flight, this makes \u003Ci\u003Eeveryone\u003C/i\u003E less safe.  Rather, airport and flight security seems better serviced as an airport-surcharge or tax.  What\u0026#x27;s missing is effective, accountable security provided by experts that we trust.
